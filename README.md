# Secure-CNN
secure CNN accelerator

This is an analysis of the memory access pattern for CHaiDNN, an open-source CNN accelerator available from Xilinx, and a simulation of secure memory access schemes for a CNN accelerator. The code for the accelerator and parsing of its memory trace is located in CHaiDNN, and the implementation of the secure memory access schemes is located in secure_models.
